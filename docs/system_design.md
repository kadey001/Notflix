## HTTPFS

- HttpFS is enabled on the server allowing for interaction with the filesystem directly through http requests. Specific details of avaliable endpoints are found at `https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.0.4/webhdfs.html`. This will be what is used for uploading/removing video files from hdfs. This possibly can be used to get the video stream as well.
